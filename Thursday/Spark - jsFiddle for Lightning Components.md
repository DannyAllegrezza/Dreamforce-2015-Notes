## Spark - jsFiddle for Lightning Components
@Scott Covert

- So lightning is stemmed from an opensource UI framework called Aura
- Lightning components run on Apex, but Aura components run on Java.
- Aura apps can be compiled and run outside of Salesforce

## Spark stack
- Spark is hosted on DigitalOcean
- Runs on MEAN.JS
- Docker packages apps into standardized containers. 
- Dokku allows you to create a private-mini-Heroku through Docker.
